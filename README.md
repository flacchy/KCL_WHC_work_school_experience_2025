# KCL WHC work school experience 2025
Public Repo for the 2025 Work School Experience at King's College London organised by Pamela Harris (WHC Department- KCL)

**Date:** Monday 07 July 2025

**Time:** 14:00-16:00

**Location:** Guys Campus 

**Details**

Amy Roberts, Flavia Flaviani, and Fewa Laleye are participanting in a work experience with the School of Life Course and Population Sciences. 
The workshop will be based on data analysis/bioinformatics for year 11-12 students visiting King's College London for work experience organised by Pamela Taylor-Harris and you can read about the [Work Experience Programme here](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/school-work-experience-programme-an-interview-with-pamela-taylor-harris-slcps-technical-manager)

Please visit the [Wiki page](https://github.com/flacchy/KCL_WHC_work_school_experience_2025/wiki) to access the materials.


**Description**

Bioinformatics analyses require skills that include extensive database management, query and analysing these data. Learning to code is a key skill in this field; there are different coding languages and here we will explore R. Just remember that once you learn one coding language, the skills are transferable, also learning to code is similar to learn a new language, there is a learning curve so be gentle. In this short session we will see the basis of coding in R, so that you can hopefully, continue the learning process after this experience.

**Why R?**

R is a freely distributed and widely used programing language and environment for statistical computing, data analysis and graphics. It is open source , widely-used and powerful programming language. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace managemen.

**Instructors**

[Flavia Flaviani](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/flavia-flaviani): 

*I am a Senior Bioinformatician for the [Hub of Applied Bioinformatics](https://hab.sites.er.kcl.ac.uk). I have a diverse background having experience in working with a variety of Next Generation Sequencing technologies, analysis of complex genomics dataset as well as having wet lab experience gained both in hospital settings, public health, and university. Within my role I support research studies with bits of code to analyse complex dataset. 
I am passionate about science and the environment and how they link with health. I have a non-conventional health path starting with working in the marine environment from big organisms and moving into bacteria and viruses.*  


[Amy Roberts](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/amy-roberts)

*Hello! I am a Research Fellow in the Department of Twin Research & Genetic Epidemiology. My research focuses on X Chromosome Inactivation and how changes to this affects the immune system and may lead to increased risk of developing age-related diseases. I hope that my research will help improve the human health-span and reduce health inequalities. Outside of work I volunteer with an LGBTQ+ organisation and enjoy going to the pub with friends.*

**Fewa Laleye**

*Hello! My name is Fewa, and I am a PhD student in the Department of Women’s and Children’s Health at KCL. My research focuses on using data to understand preterm phenotypes and identifying potential biomarkers in maternal blood to predict the risk of preterm birth. I hope my work can enhance our understanding of the mechanisms associated with preterm birth to help improve the health outcomes for both mother and baby. Outside of my PhD, I enjoy playing tennis, traveling, and going for walks!*
